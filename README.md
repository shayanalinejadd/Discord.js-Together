You can get whatever you want in index.js :0

I made this because I'm having "node-fetch" problems because of the discord.gg/10003 code? ,I made this as a replacement without problems

- you don't need npms (You only need "Discord.js")

- This only works in Discord.js v13 only, does not work in Discord v12 

(reason: Added "targetApplication, targetType" in Discord.js v13 while it is not present in Discord.js v12)
